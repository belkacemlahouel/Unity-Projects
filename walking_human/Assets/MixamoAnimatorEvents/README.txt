The Mixamo Animator Event System is best used with objects or consistant events on characters, such as effects needed at a certain moment of an attack. This is a beta and isn't finished but is in working condition. Feel free to edit as you like.

To Use:
1. Attach "AnimatorEvents" script to any GameObject with an Animator component.

2. Tag the STATES in the Animator Controller you wish to set events on. The same tag can be used on more than one state but is not advised as they timing will be off.

3. Set up the each event in AnimatorEvents script and Enjoy.

An Example is provided showing you how everything is set up for basic footsteps.
